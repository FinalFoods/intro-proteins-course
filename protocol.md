# Protocol
### Kit for Recombinant E.coli GFP Production

[List of Materials](https://github.com/FinalFoods/intro-proteins-course/blob/main/Kit_Components.md)

## 1. Upstream Process

1. **Cover** the top of the baffled flask with filter paper using two pieces of tape. 
2. **Sterilize** the baffled flask in an autoclave at 121째C for 15 minutes. 
2.  **Collect** _E.coli_ from the GFP _E.coli_ stab vial (#G-02) using the inoculation loop (#G-01) . 
3. **Streak** gently the bacteria over a section of the agar plate (#G-03). 
4. **Incubate** the plate with the agar facing toward the table. Let the _E.coli_ grow at room temperature for 12 hours.
4. **Transfer** some _E.coli_ from the plate and place it into the preculture tube (#G-04). 
5. **Incubate** the preculture tube in a shaking incubator at 37째C for 12 hours.

## 2. Fermentation Process
1. **Transfer** 50ml Lysogeny Broth w/amp (#G-05) into the baffled flask.
2. **Inoculate** the baffled flask with 500ul of the preculture. 
2. **Incubate** the flask at 37째C in a shaking incubator at 200rpm for 3.5 hours.
3. **Add** 50ul of IPTG (#G-06) to the flask to induce expression of GFP. 
4. **Incubate** the culture in the flask at 37째C in a shaking incubator at 200rpm for 12 hours. After 12 hours of incubation the culture should be visibly green. 

## 3. Downstream Process
1. **Transfer** 10ml of culture into 4 separate 15ml tubes. 
2. **Centrifuge** at 1000G for 10 minutes. 
3. **Discard** the supernatant (The liquid on top of the cell pellet).
4. **Wash** the pellet with 2ml of ice cold STE buffer (#G-07).
5. **Resuspend** the pellet in 800ul of STE buffer (#G-07) with 8ul of Lysozyme (#G-08) to obtain a cell lysate.
6. **Incubate** the cell lysate on ice for 2 hours.
7. **Add** 4ul of DTT (#G-09) to the cell lysate.
8. **Add** 135ul of Sarkosyl (#G-10) to the cell lysate
10. **Centrifuge** the cell lysate for 20 minutes at 3000G.
11. **Transfer** the cell lysate supernatant into a new tube. 
12. **Add** 200ul of Triton X-100 (#G-11).
13. **Wash** the Nickel Agarose beads (#G-12) twice with 1ml of ice cold PBS (#G-13) in their own tube. Centrifuge for 20 seconds between washes (to pellet the beads).
14. **Add** the cell lysate to the beads.
15. **Incubate** beads in a shaking incubator at room temperature for 30 minutes. 
16. **Centrifuge** for 20 seconds (to pellet beads), and discard the clear liquid.
17. **Add** 1ml of 20mM Imidazole (#G-14) kept in ice to the beads. **Mix** with a vortex.
18. **Centrifuge** the mix for 20 seconds. Discard liquid.
19. **Repeat** steps 17 through 18 four times.
17. **Add** 1ml of 100mM Imidazole (#G-15) kept in ice to the beads. **Mix** with a vortex.
18. **Centrifuge** the mix for 20 seconds.***
19. **Transfer** the liquid into an empty 1.7ml tube. These tubes contain purified GFP.
19. **Repeat** steps 17 through 19 eight times.
17. **Transfer** each GFP fraction in the tubes into the 10,000 kDa centrifugal filter unit (#G-16). 
18. **Centrifuge** the filter for 30 minutes at 1000G.
18. **Transfer** the concentrated GFP into a new 1.7ml tube. You now have pure GFP!
