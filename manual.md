# Introduction to Recombinant Protiens


### Upstream Process

1. With two pieces of tape attach a piece of filter paper to the top of the baffled shake flask. Autoclave at 121C for 15 minutes.
2. Open the GFP Ecoli Stab vial, and press the innoculation loop into the stab in the agar.
2. Slide the innoculation loop over the agar plate to sreak the ecoli onto the plate. Incubate the plate with the agar facing toward the table. Let the ecoli grow at room temperature overnight.
3. Pick some ecoli from the plate and place it into the preculture tube. Incubate the preculture tube with shaking at 37C overnight.
4. Pour the 50ml LB(Lysogeny Broth) containing ampicillin into the baffled shake flask.


### Fermentation

1. Innoculate the baffled shake flask containing 50ml of LB with 500ul of the preculture. 
2. Incubate the flask at 37C at 200rpm in a shaking incubator for 3.5 hours.
3. Induce expression of GFP by adding 50ul of IPTG.
4. Let this flask grow for 12 hours - overnight - then the culture is ready for harvesting. After 12 hours of incubation the culture should be visibly green. 

### Downstream Process

1. Pipette or pour 10ml of culture into 4 15ml tubes. 
2. Balance the tubes using a scale, then centrifuge at 1000g for 10 minutes. 
3. Discard the supernatunt (The liquid on top of the cell pellet).
4. Wash the pellet with 2ml of ice cold STE buffer.
5. Resuspend the pellet in 800ul o f STE buffer with 8ul of lysozyme.
6. Incubate on ice for 15 minutes.
7. Add 4ul of DTT to the cell lysate.
8. Add 135ul of sarkosyl to the cell lysate
9. Use ultrasonic homogenization to break up the cells. The Ultrasonic Homogenizer should be set to 50% power -25% pulses- for 12 minutes on ice. 
10. Centrifuge lysate for 20 minutes at 3000g. Make sure to balance the centrifuge.
11. Transfer the lysate supernatunt to a new tube. 
12. Add 200ul of Triton X-100.
13. Wash the nickle Agarose Beads twice with 1ml of ice cold PBS. Centrifuge between washes to pellet the agarose.
14. Add the lysate to the beads, and incubate in a shaking incubator at room temperature for 30-60 minutes. Centrifuge to pellet agarose, and discard the clear liquid. 
15. Wash the beads 4 times with 1ml of ice cold PBS with low concentration (20mM) imidazole. Centrifuge for 20 seconds between washes to pellet the agarose. Discard the liquid.
16. Wash the beads 8 times with 1ml of ice cold PBS with high concentration of imidazole (100mM). Keep the fractions in 1.7ml tubes, because they contain the purified GFP.  
17. Pipette the fractions into a 30,000 kda centrifugational filter unit. Centrifuge for 30 minutes at 1000g. 
18. Pipette the concentrated GFP into a new 1.7ml tube. You now have pure GFP!
